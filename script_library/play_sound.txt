/* Here's all you need to play a sound from an item. You'll need to play around with the values to get it correct.
500 is supposedly the distance, but i don't know which one is the correct one so just change both.
You'll need an object called "loudspeaker" from where the sound originates and an object called "Controller" from which players will be able to play the sound (once, for this code)
The following goes at the bottom of description.ext:

/* ---------------- STARTCODE ---------------- */

class CfgSounds
{
	sounds[] = {S1};

	class S1
	{
		sound[] = {"sounds\song.ogg",db+40,1,500};
		name = "TestSound1";
		titles[] = {};
	};

};

/* ---------------- ENDCODE ---------------- */


And this goes in customScripts.sqf instead:


/* ---------------- STARTCODE ---------------- */

soundFlag = true;
playSound = {
	loudspeaker say3D ["S1",500];
	soundFlag=false;
};
	
	
[
    Controller, // Object the action is attached to
    "Start the Broadcast", // Title of the action
    "\a3\ui_f\data\IGUI\Cfg\holdactions\holdAction_connect_ca.paa", // Idle icon shown on screen
    "\a3\ui_f\data\IGUI\Cfg\holdactions\holdAction_connect_ca.paa", // Progress icon shown on screen
    "_this distance _target < 3 && soundFlag", // Condition for the action to be shown
    "_caller distance _target < 3", // Condition for the action to progress
    {}, // Code executed when action starts
    {}, // Code executed on every progress tick
    { [] remoteExec ["playSound", 0, false]; }, // Code executed on completion
    {}, // Code executed on interrupted
    [], // Arguments passed to the scripts as _this select 3
    10, // Action duration [s]
    0, // Priority
    true, // Remove on completion
    false // Show in unconscious state
] call BIS_fnc_holdActionAdd; // MP compatible implementation
